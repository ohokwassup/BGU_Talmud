Plan for this session: 
     To read stuff and become a real Jewish mentsch!

What was accomplished this session: 
     I did nothing, in the end

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     I will be a bum, it seems

Plan for this session: 
     To clarify that both this entry and the previous entry in this log are tests and should not be taken seriously

What was accomplished this session: 
     I clarified a potentially fatal confusion

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     This log file seems to be very readable, however with many entries (or with long entries) browsing this file may prove tedious

Plan for this session: 
     Read on generators and chapters 3 and 4 of NLTK

What was accomplished this session: 
     Read chapters 1 + 2 + 3, and looked briefly at four, set up nltk on comp.

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     NLTK tools will aid tremendously, but only if one is comfortably familiar with them. I must review chapter 4 and experiment using nltk on the files i have

Plan for this session: 
     Try to tokenize an excerpt of Talmud using NLTK and display frequency and other such info

What was accomplished this session: 
     Set up initial files reviewed ch 4

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     no different, will continue in the am

Plan for this session: 
     create git repository, how to efficiently tokenize all of talmud?, create list of names from word doc

What was accomplished this session: 
     reformatted tokenizer.py, created repository, discovered how long tokenizing the entire text can take...still waiting

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     I must still create the list of names and learn faster way to tokenize large data (generators?)

Plan for this session: 
     read input with generator, save tokens externally (as csv), explore some classes

What was accomplished this session: 
     implemented generator, having problems unpickling freqdist

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     it is difficult to know exactly what nltk is doing unless you look at source, how much does freqdist compute on initalization?

Plan for this session: 
     to fix unpickling problem

What was accomplished this session: 
     fixed 

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     move on to iexploring statistics, but test tokenization with large data first

Plan for this session: 
     clean up what i have of tokenizer, improve efficiency, explore classes

What was accomplished this session: 
     cleaned up slightly. discovered problem with nltks tokenizer punctuation extraction--it dissects abbreviated names

The new perspective of the project and vision of its future: 
     need to figure out how to adjust the punctuation rules
